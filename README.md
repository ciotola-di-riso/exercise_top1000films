# exercise_top1000films
Trying to answer three statistical questions about actors in the top1000 films.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
To help me with learning Python, a friend sent me two .tsv files with data about the top 1000 films and the actors that took part in them.
Working with this data, I have to answer three questions:

1) Which actor has participated in the most films?
2) Calculate the median of the number of actors in a film.
3) Which actor has collaborated with the most actors?

For each question, you must provide the answer considering:
- only the top 100
- only the top 200
- only the top 400
- only the top 600
- only the top 800
- all the top 1000

I'm a philosophy graduate, a humanities-person if you will, and not particularly gifted with anything that is even remotely mathematical.
So for me this is already a pretty big challenge - please be nice with my crappy code:)
